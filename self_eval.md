# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    - It is useful when one variable has to be 'true' or 'false' in order to satisfy an if statement. An example would be the car insurance problem in the medium code_challenge. 
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    - I think that I did everything pretty well in terms of the technical exercises. I already knew about the modulo '%' comparison due to my experience with python. It's cool to bring code syntax/ theory from one language to another, but perhaps I should've googled another way to solve the problem since there are always multiple ways to solve problems. I wish that Loom would've let me record more than five minutes so I could explain my code more instead of having a time crunch. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    - I'm satisfied that I used my prior knowledge to bring in practices from other coding languages. It makes me satisfied to know that I could complete and trouble shoot the spicy code challenge in a short amount of time. When getting stumped on the challenge I didn't get frazzled and I kept a cool head and looked at the code that I wrote and found where I was going wrong.
